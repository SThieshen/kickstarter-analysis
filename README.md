## Setting a realistic crowdfunding goal

  * Based on the data available in our 'Descriptive Statistics' file, under the tab with the same name, data concludes:
  
      1 Successful play campaigns had an average goal of $5,049, with the average pledge being $5,602.
      
      2 Failed play campaigns had a much higher average goal at $10,554, with the average pledge being $559.

        -which tells us, setting a lower crowdfunding goal of around $5,000, produces better outcomes.

        -Also look at our chart analyzing 'Great Britain Musicals'- 
          this visual tells us that the average campaign goal is around £4,000, 
          and because this falls out of range of any outliers in our data for the 
          actual pledged amount, it would be best to try to produce under £2,000.
