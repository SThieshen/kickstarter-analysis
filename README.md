Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project


## Purpose


## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


### CHallenges and Difficulties Encountered

  * Based on the data available in our 'Descriptive Statistics' file, under the tab with the same name, data concludes:
  
    - Successful play campaigns had an average goal of $5,049, with the average pledge being $5,602.
      
    - Failed play campaigns had a much higher average goal at $10,554, with the average pledge being $559.

    This tells us, setting a lower crowdfunding goal of around $5,000, produces better outcomes.
    
    

  - Analyzing 'Great Britain Musicals'- https://github.com/SThieshen/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/GB_musicals.png
        
    This visual tells us that the average campaign goal is around £4,000, and because this falls out of range of any outliers in our data for the actual pledged amount,      it would be best to try to produce under £2,000.
   
   
   
## Results

  * Based on the analysis of our data, it would be best launch to a crowdfunding campaign for a play in May or June, with the goal around $5,000.
