# **Kickstarting with Excel**

## Overview of Project

          With this project, analysis was performed on Kickstarter data to uncover trends to help determine characteristics of 
     successful crowdfunding campaigns. Overall analysis included determining trends that indicated increased success with a 
     campaign, including campaign type, goal of campaign, launch and end dates, number of backers, amounts pledged, and location
     of campaign launched. This information allowed us to determine which factors increased likelihood of a successful 
     crowdfunding campaign.
          
## Purpose
         
          The purpose of this project was to help an up-and-coming playwright, Louise. She wanted to start a crowdfunding campaign
     to help fund her play, *Fever*. Louise originally planned a budget of over $10,000, but was hesitant to start the campaign
     without more information. She wanted input from an Excel power user, for help, in hopes of being successful at crowdfunding
     her play. Within this analysis, we were able to determine certain factors and trends that led to success with a campaign and
     provide useful information to Louise, to help her make a more informed decision regarding the fundraising for her play.

## Analysis and Challenges
          
          The data we analyzed for Louise, originated from a large data set that required some effort to make sense from, just due
    to the sheer volume of data provided. First, we determined, based on the category of the fundraiser, if crowdfunding
    a play would even be a good idea. Fortunately for Louise, the theater/play category actually had some of the best corwdfunding
    results! Although the data set did provide outcomes of each campaign, meaning if it succeeded or failed, we were still interested
    in seeing the percentage of funding received in each campaign, if it went over its goal or came close to reaching it. This required
    dividing the amount pledged by the goal. This provided us insight on campaigns that exceeded goals, as well as ones that, while 
    labeled 'failed', were actually close to their established goal. One specific challenge encountered with the data set, was the 
    formatting for the deadline and launched dates. This required formatting prior to even being able to analyze the dates.
    
    
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


### CHallenges and Difficulties Encountered

  * Based on the data available in our 'Descriptive Statistics' file, under the tab with the same name, data concludes:
  
    - Successful play campaigns had an average goal of $5,049, with the average pledge being $5,602.
      
    - Failed play campaigns had a much higher average goal at $10,554, with the average pledge being $559.

    This tells us, setting a lower crowdfunding goal of around $5,000, produces better outcomes.
    
    

  - Analyzing 'Great Britain Musicals'- https://github.com/SThieshen/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/GB_musicals.png
        
    This visual tells us that the average campaign goal is around £4,000, and because this falls out of range of any outliers in our data for the actual pledged amount,      it would be best to try to produce under £2,000.
   
   
   
## Results

  * Based on the analysis of our data, it would be best launch to a crowdfunding campaign for a play in May or June, with the goal around $5,000.
