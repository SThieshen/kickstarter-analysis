# **Kickstarting with Excel**
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project

          The goal of the project was to help an up-and-coming playwright, Louise. She wanted to start a crowdfunding campaign
     to help fund her play, *Fever*. Louise originally planned a budget of over $10,000, but was hesitant to start the campaign
     without more information. She wanted input from an Excel power user, for help, in hopes of being successful at crowdfunding
     her play. Within this analysis, we look at various aspects of crowdfunding, including types of events, fundraising goals,
     campaign launch dates, and locations of the campaigns, just to name a few.


## Purpose


## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


### CHallenges and Difficulties Encountered

  * Based on the data available in our 'Descriptive Statistics' file, under the tab with the same name, data concludes:
  
    - Successful play campaigns had an average goal of $5,049, with the average pledge being $5,602.
      
    - Failed play campaigns had a much higher average goal at $10,554, with the average pledge being $559.

    This tells us, setting a lower crowdfunding goal of around $5,000, produces better outcomes.

    This visual tells us that the average campaign goal is around £4,000, and because this falls out of range of any outliers in our data for the actual pledged amount,      it would be best to try to produce under £2,000.
   
   
   
## Results

  * Based on the analysis of our data, it would be best launch to a crowdfunding campaign for a play in May or June, with the goal around $5,000.
